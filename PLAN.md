# Plan of action

## What do we want this to actually do?

 1. Solve an existing board

   * "Where is the best place (if any) to push the spare piece in order to win my move?"
   * Do AR and show where to put the piece, and what the route should be?

 2. Have a computer version of the game you can play with someone else if you've lost the pieces?

 3. Have a computer version of the game you can play with someone else on the internet if you've lost the pieces?

We chose option 1a.

## Steps
 * Tell the computer about what tiles we have ✅

 * Tell the computer how to draw the route from one tile to another ✅
 * Tell the computer how you push a tile into the board
     * Tell the computer how to draw pushing a tile into the board (don't need this if we're just doing a solver)
 * Tell the computer where the players are on the board
